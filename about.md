Hi,

My name is Harsh. Different people call me by different names; some say Bunny, some say Avi, but most people call me crazy!

I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT BHU Varanasi. My stay and journey at Varanasi was one of the most beautiful experience I could ever have or gather in my lifetime! I started living in a place where people decide to die! Kashi :)

By profession, I am a researcher and an entrepreneur in making. I work in the field of Robotics and Machine Learning, trying to make machines intelligent, and contributing my teeny-tiny bit to the cognitive shift that seems to occur in the upcoming era. For my professional interests, have a look at my LinkedIn Profile.

Currently, I am working on Cognitive Assistance at Carnegie Mellon as a research Assistant and a Masters Student in Robotics. Primarily my work is based on development of approaches for efficient and robust localisation in SLAM for mobile devices.

My other interests include: reading books, watching movies, making movies, writing scripts and reviews for films and theatre. I am also keen on pursuing music! We had made a short film [Stopping by Woods | Large Short Film | IIT (BHU)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_3XKqsJZk) and some random videos as a member of the [Film & Media Council, IIT (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt4-7kmQaPEZzPLil4RNRCw). Have a look!

Feel free to conatct me if you have anything in mind that you feel is worth sharing and can have a larger impact on the universe! One of favourite quotes are: 

> Talent hits a target no one else can hit, however, a genius hits a target no one else can see!
Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

>-Arthur Schopenhauer and Steve Jobs

Cheers! 

### A bit more! 

I am keen on working on ideas that contribute significantly to the society and are innovative. Fields of interests, myriad. Presently Deep Learning (primarily Computer Vision, you have something more interesting, do tell me about it). Getting the content within the context is what fascinates me so much about DL. Just imagine since we were born we are being fed with so much of data around the world visualising every single thing that we intuitively learn so much! Can we do that with a machine?

I run a small group of esoteric people called DeepLearningIsLife in my campus to promulgate DL. We five people write articles that can be found in the blog section of this site and perform experiments that help us in getting a panoptic view of Deep Learning and it's applications in various fields. The group consists of: 

- [Deeksha Kaurav](mailto:deeksha.kaurav.mat15@itbhu.ac.in)
- [Maneeshita Sharma](mailto:maneeshita.sharma.mat15@itbhu.ac.in)
- [Shubham Gautam](mailto:shubham.gautam.mat15@itbhu.ac.in) 
- [Shivam Kalra](mailto:shivam.kalra.mat15@itbhu.ac.in) 

We work under the supervision of [Dr. K.V. Srinivas](https://sites.google.com/site/kvsrinivas/). 

I am also trying to work on a social venture called Banares Dialogues along with Mr. Anupam Raghuvanshi, that concerns with the development of global youth dialogue. We are not a pressure group forcing governments to bring about change. We are the change. Primarily coming up with a solution that is practicable and intelligible. The current focus is on Education System in India. We feel that somewhere down the line in the quest towards becoming successful we have lost our passion for developing life skills like creativity, communication and so on! Any suggestions in this regard please feel free to mail :)
