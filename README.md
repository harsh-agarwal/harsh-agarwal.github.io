This is the repository for my personal website. I am a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast. We run a small group called DLisLife in our campus and write articles about our experiments that we perform. For the time being these articles are being hosted here by the time the website is being prepared and the group is being formulated. The group consists of the following: 

- Harsh Agarwal 
- Deeksha Kaurav 
- Maneeshita Sharma 
- Shubham Gautam 
- Shivam Kalra 

The group works under the supervision of Dr. K.V. Srinivas. We are trying to work on simple problems that help us in getting an understanding and a panopti view of Deep Learning and it's applicactions as a whole.
