Hi,

My name is Harsh Agarwal. People close to me call me Avi, my mom used to :)   

I am keen on working on ideas that contribute significantly to the society and are innovative. Fields of interests, myriad. Presently Deep Learning (primarily Computer Vision, you have something more interesting, do tell me about it). Getting the content within the context is what fascinates me so much about DL. Just imagine since we were born we are being fed with so much of data around the world visualising every single thing that we intuitively learn so much! Can we do that with a machine? 

I run a small group of esoteric people called DeepLearningIsLife in my campus to promulgate DL. The group is run under the supervision of [Dr. K.V. Srinivas](https://sites.google.com/site/kvsrinivas/). We are trying to explore several aspects of Deep Leraning and keep on writing about our experiments on our blog. Currently, we are trying to work on ....   

I am also trying to work on a social venture called Banares Dialogues along with Mr. Anupam Raghuvanshi, that concerns with the development of global youth dialogue. We are not a pressure group forcing governments to bring about change. We are the change. Primarily coming up with a solution that is practicable and intelligible. The current focus is on Education System in India. We feel that somewhere down the line in the quest towards becoming successful we have lost our passion for developing life skills like creativity, communication and so on! Any suggestions in this regard please feel free to mail :)  

Precisely:

I am a researcher, wanna be entrepreneur, a cinephile, a voracious reader, musician, writer, gregarious, a foodie ;)

Cheers, 
Avi
