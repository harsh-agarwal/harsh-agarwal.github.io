title: A Beginners guide to Vision and DL! 
---

When I started working on Deep Learning and Computer Vision I had one of the finest mentors Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhtla from IISc Bangalore, who helped me around in getting a kick start in this field by making a log that consists of the relevant links that helped me go through and learn various concepts with ease. They are in essence related links from multiple blogs that are present on the internet that helps you skim through specific articles and topics from a particular source. Hope they help you even :) 

We are in th process of making a similar log for NLP enthusiasts. Would be posting that as soonas it is ready!
