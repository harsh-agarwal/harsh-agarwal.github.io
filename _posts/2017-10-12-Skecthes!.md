title : Delving into sketches! 
---

After my sophomore year I started working on sketches! Sketches are very different from images. Let's take an example to understand this. 

IMAGES TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE! 

Even though sketches are so different, yet humans are able to understand skecthes pretty intuitively and easily. There are some characteristic features that are involved with a particular type of sketches. we somhow have been trained to recognise such features given the enormous data that we have been fed with since our childhood! Can we expect a neural network to do that job? 

This was my project at IISc Bangalore, which I ended up getting after my quest of augmenting anything that we think about. You can read about that .......

The idea was to understand sketches in detail. So we started working on this project! How to approach this problem? The basic idea is that: 

> Images have too much of information and sketches have too sparse information. So we need to somehow decrease the information in the images and increase the information in a skecth to come to a mid level representation that can be used to compare these two entities! 

Simple enough! But how do we do it? We don't really have a dataset dedicated to sketch segmentation and annotation! So we started collecting dataset at the same time thinking about alternatives. 

After several failed attempts we finally decided to simply sketchify the images in PASCAL VOC Dataset. So in essence we brought image to the sketch embedding space. Now we can train this network on these transformed images.
