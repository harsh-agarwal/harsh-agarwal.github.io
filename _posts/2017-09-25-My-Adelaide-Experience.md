After completion of my prefinal year I went for a research internship to Australian Centre of Robotic Vision under 
Prof. Ian Reid. My work was primarily based on merging elements of Deep Learning into SLAM. So just imagine when we move we are intutively able to decide that we are about collide, isn't it? We don't really apply geometry or have too many sensors 
around. We just are able to understand stuff. How? Can we do this kind of a motion estimation with a machine! This was my project. However we wanted to use geometry as a prior ....
