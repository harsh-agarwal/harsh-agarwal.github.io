Hi,

You read my headline, and you feel you know me? I bet not! 

I am keen on working on ideas that contribute significantly to the society and are innovative. Fields of interests, myriad. Presently Deep Learning (primarily Computer Vision, you have something more interesting, do tell me about it). I am trying to work on problems based on Augmented Reality, SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) and trying to find out solutions using DL in my research endeavours. These ideas have fascinated me since a long time, and now I am trying to convert them into reality. 

I am also trying to work on a social venture, that concerns with the development of global youth dialogue.
We are not a pressure group forcing governments to bring about change. We are the change. Primarily coming up with a solution that is practicable and intelligible. The current focus is on Education System in India. 

I believe that the human conscience is connected so there is a very high probability that if you are thinking about something I too may be thinking about it somewhere in my subconscious mind. Let's interact and create a synergy. 

Precisely:

I am a researcher, wanna be entrepreneur, a cinephile, a voracious reader, musician, writer, gregarious, a foodie ;)
